# ōly — AI-Powered Personal Beauty & Skincare Ecosystem

ōly is a luxury MERN-stack e-commerce platform that bridges the gap between traditional retail and personalized skincare through generative AI. Built as a proof-of-concept for a venture-building environment, it leverages the **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** model to provide real-time skin analysis and color harmony consultation.

## 🌟 Unique Value Proposition (MVP Features)

While standard e-commerce focuses on transactions, ōly focuses on **Validation and Personalization**:

- **AI Beauty Assistant**: A natively integrated chatbot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to suggest products based on skin concerns.
- - **Skin Diary with Longitudinal AI Tracking** ← **NEW**  
  Users upload weekly close-up photos → AI estimates **hydration (0–100)** and **acne severity (0–10)** scores → visual progress charts and trend lines show whether products/routines are actually working over time. Provides tangible proof-of-efficacy for premium skincare purchases.
- **Visual Skin Analysis**: Users can upload or capture photos for real-time analysis of skin texture, age estimation, and health insights.
- **Personal Color Harmony**: A 15-point diagnostic quiz combined with AI vision to determine a user's seasonal color palette (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn).
- **AI-Moderated Community Forum (The "Skin Journey")**:A real-time hub for users to share personal skincare transformations, fostering emotional connections in a social-driven market.
(e.g., *"80% of users with oily skin in high-humidity regions prefer tea tree formulations"*).
